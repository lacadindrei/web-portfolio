<!-- The internet and the world -->
how the internet started
1957 - Time sharing
1960 - Packet switching
*Packet loss - Loss of data through transmission

ARPANET - First network
(Advanced Research Project Agencies Network)
- UCLA
- Standford
- University of California in Utah
- University of California in Sta Barbara
*Schools used ARPANET for research

<!-- Founders of the internet: --> 
Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn are recognized as the fathers of internet.

TCP/IP - Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol

Three layers of network:
1. Application
2. Internet - How computers talk
3. Network Interface - Physical connection

IP - Internet protocol
Modem - Modulator/Demodulator
ISP - Internet Service Provider

<!-- Is it possible for an individual user to bypass ISPs altogether and connect directly to the "Internet backbone” -->?
-Yes but not practical as it's expensive and you have to manage your own network and make yourself an ISP.

B. Internet Layer
The IP has 3 functions
1. Identification of each device connected to the network
2. The format of the messages
3. Routing the messages from the source to the destination

DNS - Domain Name System

<!-- Tuitt Blog Site -->
https://blog.tuitt.com/

Parts of a Domain
www.example.com
subdomain - second-level domain - TLD (Third-level domain)

Packet routing - Sending packets

<!-- Difference of the Internet and WWW -->
The internet - connection of computers
The World Wide Web - The system we use to access the Internet


Front-end is the client
Back-end is the server

URL - Uniform Resource Locator
Protocol - domain name - directory - file - file extension
