<!-- Many web pages act like electronic versions of documents -->

Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) describes the STRUCTURE of web pages

Activity 1

1. create a folder named mod01-01 in Documents
2. create a file called index.html
3. create the assets folder also (img,css,js) folders
4. open index.html in sublime text

Document Structure:
<!-- Headings -->
- Provide the title or theme for each section of the page
- There are six levels (or "ranks") of headings - h1, h2 ,h3, h4, h5, h
- Headings of the same level imply equal rank on the page
- Block elements

Do's:

1. Make sure each tag supports its preceding sequential number when using H3, H4, H5 & H6 tas.
2. Include only one H1 tag on each page. It should describe the topic of your page.
3. Create a direct correlation between the language used in your H1 header and your Title tag.

Dont's:
1. Use the same heading on every page.
2. Use heading tags solely to increase font size.
3. Use heading tags for lage bodies of text. (20-70 characters should be enough)

<!-- Paragraphs -->
- Defines a simple paragraph of text
- Block element

<!-- Divisions -->
<div></div>

<div align=""> - to align divs

<!-- Spans -->
 - Used to create inline elements

<p lang="en-US">This paragraph is written in American english.</p>

<!-- Line Break -->
- Defines a break in a line

<!-- Horizontal Rule -->
- Creates break between themes -- such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play
- adds a horizontal line by default
- Block element

<!-- Text Formatting -->
- Strong

<!-- Bold vs Strong -->
- Bold Tag - not a logical tag, it styles text by making it bold; It does not give text any meaning
- Strong Tag - a logical tag, it styles text and also gives it meaning
